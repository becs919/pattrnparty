# pattrnparty

Pattrn Party was a three week design project during module 4 in which each week we were given a specific page element to build. It must be responsive, and the HTML, CSS, and (when/if needed) JS must be written in a modular way. The goal was to create a small library of page components that can be quickly and easily dropped into a project with minimal work to integrate them into a codebase.
